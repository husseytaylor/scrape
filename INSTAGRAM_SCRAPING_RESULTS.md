## ⚠️ Important Limitations

### Critical Limitation: Liked Posts

Instagram liked posts are:
- ❌ Completely private
- ❌ Hidden since 2019
- ❌ Not accessible without user's login
- ❌ Not even visible to friends
- ❌ Cannot be scraped by ANY method

**This is a fundamental Instagram privacy feature that cannot be bypassed.**

### Other Limitations
1. Only 60% of posts captured (login wall)
2. Limited engagement data
3. No comment extraction
4. No follower list details
5. No story access

---

## 🎯 Recommendations

### For Better Instagram Data

1. **Use Official Tools**
   - Instagram Insights (for your own account)
   - Creator Studio
   - Official Instagram Graph API

2. **Alternative Approaches**
   - Focus on posted content analysis
   - Track engagement patterns
   - Monitor profile growth over time

3. **Different Platforms**
   - TikTok (we already built this - liked videos CAN be public)
   - Twitter/X (likes are public)
   - Pinterest (saves can be public)

### For This Specific Use Case

Since you wanted **activity data** (especially likes):

**Best Option:** Use TikTok instead
- ✅ Liked videos can be public
- ✅ Full activity tracking possible
- ✅ We already have working scraper
- ✅ Better data access

**Instagram Alternative:** Focus on what IS available
- Posted content analysis
- Engagement metrics
- Content strategy insights
- Growth tracking

---

## 🔚 Conclusion

Successfully scraped **public Instagram data** for @abby.barger:
- ✅ Complete profile information
- ✅ 27 posts captured
- ✅ Engagement metrics analyzed
- ✅ Top performing content identified
- ❌ **Liked posts: NOT available** (Instagram privacy feature)

**Main Request Status:** ❌ **Liked posts cannot be scraped from Instagram**

This is a fundamental limitation of Instagram, not the scraper. Instagram made all likes private in 2019, and there is no way to see what posts anyone has liked (except your own, when logged in as yourself).

**For activity tracking with liked content, TikTok is the better platform** - we already have a working scraper that captured 9 liked videos for @.wabby.
