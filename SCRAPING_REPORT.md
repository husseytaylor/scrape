---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Notes

1. **Missing Videos:** Captured 18 out of 26 stated videos. Possible reasons:
   - Some videos may be deleted
   - Some may be private or draft
   - API pagination may not have loaded all content

2. **Data Accuracy:** All data accurate as of scraping timestamp. TikTok metrics update in real-time.

3. **Liked Videos:** Unable to determine if liked videos are private or if they're included in the "other videos" capture.

4. **Comments:** Individual video comments were not scraped (would require separate API calls per video).

5. **Ethical Considerations:** All scraped data is publicly available. Respect user privacy and TikTok's Terms of Service.

### For Further Analysis:
1. Scrape comments for sentiment analysis
2. Track follower growth over time
3. Analyze posting patterns (times, days)
4. Compare engagement rates with similar profiles

### For Enhanced Scraping:
1. Implement authentication for private content access
2. Add retry logic for failed API calls
