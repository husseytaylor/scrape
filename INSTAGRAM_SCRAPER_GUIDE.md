# Instagram Advanced Activity Scraper Guide

**Critical Update:** Instagram liked posts are **NOT public data** and cannot be scraped.

---

## üö® The Liked Posts Problem

### What You Asked For: ‚ùå **NOT POSSIBLE**
- **Liked Posts:** Completely private, hidden from everyone except the user
- **Changed in 2019:** Instagram removed the ability to see others' likes

### Why This Is Important:
Unlike TikTok where liked videos can be public:
- Instagram likes are **always private**
- No API access to others' likes
- Not visible in web or app
- Cannot be scraped without authentication (and even then, only YOUR OWN)

## üíª Instagram Scraper Implementation

Here's what we can actually build:

### 1. Profile Scraper

```python
def scrape_instagram_profile(username: str) -> Dict:
    """
    Scrape public Instagram profile data
    """
    profile_data = {
        'username': username,
        'profile_info': {},
        'posts': [],
        'engagement_metrics': {},
        'hashtag_analysis': {},
        'posting_patterns': {}
    }
    
    # Navigate to profile
    url = f"https://www.instagram.com/{username}/"
    page.goto(url)
    
    # Extract profile info
    profile_data['profile_info'] = extract_profile_info(page)
    
    # Extract posts (scroll and load)
    profile_data['posts'] = extract_all_posts(page, username)
    
    # Analyze patterns
    profile_data['engagement_metrics'] = analyze_engagement(posts)
    profile_data['hashtag_analysis'] = analyze_hashtags(posts)
    profile_data['posting_patterns'] = analyze_posting_times(posts)
    
    return profile_data
```

### 2. Post Scraper with Full Metadata

```python
def extract_post_details(post_url: str) -> Dict:
    """
    Extract complete details from an Instagram post
    """
    post_data = {
        'url': post_url,
        'type': None,  # photo, video, carousel
        'caption': None,
        'timestamp': None,
        'likes': 0,
        'comments': 0,
        'hashtags': [],
        'mentions': [],
        'location': None,
        'tagged_users': [],
        'comments_list': []
    }
    
    # Navigate to post
    page.goto(post_url)
    time.sleep(2)
    
    # Extract metadata
    post_data['caption'] = page.locator('h1').inner_text()
    post_data['likes'] = page.locator('[href*="liked_by"]').inner_text()
    
    # Extract hashtags from caption
    hashtags = re.findall(r'#(\w+)', post_data['caption'])
    post_data['hashtags'] = hashtags
    
    # Extract mentions
    mentions = re.findall(r'@(\w+)', post_data['caption'])
    post_data['mentions'] = mentions
    
    # Get comments
    post_data['comments_list'] = extract_comments(page)
    
    return post_data
```

### 3. Comment Activity Scraper

```python
def find_user_comments(username: str, search_accounts: List[str]) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Find comments made by user on other accounts
    """
    comments_made = []
    
    for account in search_accounts:
        # Get posts from this account
        posts = get_account_posts(account)
        
        for post in posts[:20]:  # Check recent posts
            # Navigate to post
            page.goto(post['url'])
            
            # Expand all comments
            while page.locator('button:has-text("View more comments")').count() > 0:
                page.click('button:has-text("View more comments")')
                time.sleep(1)
            
            # Find comments by target user
            comments = page.locator(f'a[href="/{username}/"]').all()
            
            for comment_link in comments:
                # Extract comment text
                comment_elem = comment_link.locator('..').locator('..')
                comment_text = comment_elem.inner_text()
                
                comments_made.append({
                    'post_url': post['url'],
                    'account': account,
                    'comment': comment_text,
                    'timestamp': extract_timestamp(comment_elem)
                })
    
    return comments_made
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Instagram Scraping Challenges

Unlike TikTok, Instagram frequently shows login walls:
- Limits how many posts you can see
- Blocks follower/following lists
- Rate limits guest browsing

### 2. Aggressive Bot Detection
- CAPTCHA challenges
- IP blocking
- Account bans (if logged in)
- Device fingerprinting

### 3. Rate Limiting
- Very strict request limits
- Progressive blocking
- Shadow bans possible

### 4. Dynamic Loading
- Infinite scroll
- Lazy loading images
- Complex JavaScript rendering

### 5. API Limitations
- Official API very limited
- No public likes access
- Requires app approval for most features

---

## üéØ Realistic Instagram Scraper

Here's what's actually achievable:

### Without Authentication (Guest):
- ‚úÖ Profile info: **100%**
- ‚úÖ Public posts: **~50-100 posts** (then login required)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Comments: **Limited access**
- ‚ùå Followers: **Blocked**
- ‚ùå Stories: **Blocked**
- ‚ùå Liked posts: **Impossible**

### With Authentication (Logged In):
- ‚úÖ Profile info: **100%**
- ‚úÖ Public posts: **All posts**
- ‚úÖ Comments: **Full access**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Followers: **Partial** (rate limited)
- ‚úÖ Stories: **Current only**
- ‚ùå Others' liked posts: **Still impossible**
- ‚úÖ YOUR liked posts: **Only your own**

---

## üí° Alternative: What You Might Actually Want

Since Instagram liked posts aren't accessible, here are alternatives:

### 1. **Analyze What They Post**
- See what content they create
- What they care about (hashtags, captions)
- Their interests through their posts

### 2. **See Who They Engage With**
- Tagged posts (collaboration)
- Comments they make
- Mentions in captions

### 3. **Track Engagement Patterns**
- What content performs best
- Audience preferences
- Growth trends

### 4. **Use Official Tools**
If you have permission:
- Instagram Insights (for business accounts)
- Creator Studio
- Official Instagram API (limited)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Should I Build an Instagram Scraper?

I can build one, but it will capture:

‚úÖ **What's Possible:**
- Complete profile analysis
- All public posts (within limits)
- Hashtag and engagement analysis
- Posting pattern insights
- Comment activity (limited)
- Tagged content

‚ùå **What's NOT Possible:**
- Liked posts (your main request)
- Saved content
- Private activity
- Full social graphs
- Stories after 24 hours

---

## ü§î My Recommendation

### Option 1: Build Limited Scraper (What's Possible)
I can create an Instagram scraper that captures everything that IS available:
- Profile + all posts
- Engagement metrics
- Hashtag analysis
- Comment patterns
- Tagged content

**Pros:** Get useful data about content and engagement  
**Cons:** Won't get liked posts (impossible)

### Option 2: Different Approach
Focus on platforms where likes ARE public:
- ‚úÖ TikTok (what we built)
- ‚úÖ Twitter/X (likes can be public)
- ‚úÖ YouTube (public playlists, not likes)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Pinterest (pins can be public)

### Option 3: Official Data Export
If you have account access:
- Instagram Data Download (Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Download Data)
- Get YOUR liked posts legally
- Complete personal activity history

## üìä Comparison Matrix

| Data Type | TikTok | Instagram | Twitter | Snapchat |
|-----------|--------|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Liked Content** | ‚úÖ Public | ‚ùå Private | ‚úÖ Public | ‚ùå Private |
| **Posted Content** | ‚úÖ Public | ‚úÖ Public | ‚úÖ Public | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited |
| **Comments** | ‚úÖ Public | ‚úÖ Public | ‚úÖ Public | ‚ùå Private |
| **Followers** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | ‚úÖ Full | ‚ùå Login |
| **Scraping Difficulty** | üü¢ Medium | üî¥ Hard | üü° Medium | üî¥ Very Hard |

---

## üéØ Bottom Line

**Your specific request (liked posts) is NOT possible on Instagram** because:
1. Instagram made likes private in 2019
2. No API access to others' likes
3. Not visible even with authentication
4. Cannot be scraped by any method

**What I CAN build:**
- Complete profile + post scraper
- Engagement analytics
- Hashtag analysis
- Comment activity tracker
- Everything EXCEPT liked posts

---

- All public posts
- Engagement metrics
- Hashtag patterns
- Comment activity

### Option B: Different Platform

- What data is available
